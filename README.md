DEP simulations

The model is for finite element analysis on dielectrophoresis of colloidal particles under AC electric fields. 
"Laplace equation" module is adopted for 1. including basic electrostatic fields properties ⁠ΔV = 0; 2. introducing specific boundary conditions. It is nearly mathematically equivalent with "electrostatics" module, but features more freedoms. 
Physical mechanisms can refer to "Ristenpart, W., Aksay, I. A. & Saville, D. Electrohydrodynamic flow around a colloidal particle near an electrode with an oscillating potential. J. Fluid Mech.575, 83–109 (2007)."
